# Information for incoming MSFE students
Entering students to Columbia Business School's MSFE program should have:
* Sufficient coding skills in either Python or R to load in a largish (a few megabytes) data set, and run regression analysis on it
  * this should be done by writing functions and/or classes, not in a giant script
  * if this isn't where your coding skills are, see below for some course suggestions that you should take prior to arriving at CBS
* Math knowledge commensurate with the notes in the `math/` folder
  * these are the notes from the 2021 math bootcamp taught by one of our PhD students Naz Koont

## Coding classes
If your coding skills are not in line with the above description, consider taking the following course (which consists of 4 modules) prior to your arrival: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science
* You will be able to access this via CBS (contact Dan Spacher)
* You can also take other intro Python or R courses that are close to (or above) this in coverage
* At the margin, you are probably better off learning Python, though both languages are excellent for the work you'll do in the MSFE (and knowing one well will make it much easier to learn the other)

## Bootcamp
When you arrive at CBS, you will take the following five bootcamp courses
* While the math and Python are optional if you feel you have enough background, I strongly advise you to take them anyway -- it's just a few hours of your time, and you may learn more than you think you will

Bootcamp courses:
* Accounting (20 hours)
* Corporate finance (20 hours)
* Capital markets and investments (20 hours)
* Python programming (9 hours)
* Math (10 hours)
