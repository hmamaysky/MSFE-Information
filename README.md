Entering students to Columbia Business School's MSFE program should have
* sufficient coding skills in either Python or R to load in a largish (a few megabytes) data set, and run regression analysis on it
  * this should be done by writing functions and/or classes, not in a giant script
  * if this isn't where your coding skills are, see below for some course suggestions that you should take prior to arriving at CBS
* math knowledge commensurate with the notes in the `math/` folder

## Coding classes
If your coding skills are not in line with the above description, consider taking the following courses prior to coming to CBS:
