# Information for incoming MSFE students
Entering students to Columbia Business School's Master of Science in Financial Economics (MSFE) program should have:
* Sufficient coding skills in either Python or R to load in a largish (a few megabytes) data set, and run regression analysis on it
  * this should be done by writing functions and/or classes, not in a giant script
  * if this isn't where your coding skills are, see below for some course suggestions that you should take prior to arriving at CBS
* Math knowledge commensurate with the notes in the `math/` folder
  * these are the notes from the 2021 math bootcamp taught by one of our PhD students Naz Koont
  * the math bootcamp only has time to introduce these concepts, and does not go into detailed proofs or derivations
  * if some or all of this material feels foreign to you, that's okay, but try to study up before you get here

## Math skills
The MSFE program is math intensive. At the very least, incoming students should be familiar with
* Multivariable calculus
* Linear algebra

Your understanding of these subjects should be at the level of an undergraduate course. If you are concerned that you do not have sufficient knowledge in one of these areas, please reach out to us so we can design a study plan for you before you arrive on campus.

Other math background that will be useful (though is not required):
* Real analysis
* Probability theory
* Ordinary and partial differential equations

## Coding classes
If your coding skills are not in line with the above description, consider taking the following courses (which consists of 4 modules) prior to your arrival:
* Python basics: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science
* Python for data science: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-science-in-python

Additional information:
* You will be able to access this via CBS sometime in early June (contact Dan Spacher to get login information)
* You can also take other intro Python or R courses that are close to (or above) this in coverage
* At the margin, you are probably better off learning Python, though both languages are excellent for the work you'll do in the MSFE (and knowing one well will make it much easier to learn the other)

## Bootcamp
When you arrive at CBS, you will take the following five bootcamp courses
* While the math and Python sessions are optional if you feel you have enough background, I strongly advise you to take them anyway -- it's just a few hours of your time, and you may learn more than you think you will

Bootcamp courses:
* Accounting (15 hours)
* Corporate finance (15 hours)
* Capital markets and investments (15 hours)
* Python programming (12 hours)
* Math (10 hours)

## Intreview prep
Pretty soon after arriving to campus, you will start to interview for summer internships. In addition to shoring up your coding and math skills, we recommend that:
* You keep on top of financial and economic news to demonstrate to employers that you know what is going on in the world. Two useful sources are the _Financial Times_ and the _Wall Street Journal_.
* In addition, you will be asked some technical questions in the early round of your interviews. Some of these will involved coding and math. There are two useful books that will give you a sense of what to expect:
  * _150 Most Frequently Asked Questions on Quant Interviews_, Dan Stefanica et al.: https://www.amazon.com/Frequently-Questions-Interviews-Second-Pocket/dp/097975769X
  * _A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews_, Xinfeng Zhou: https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662
